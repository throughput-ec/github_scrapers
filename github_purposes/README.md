# Why is this repository here?

## Purposes

There are 73,000 cataloged code repositories within Throughput. These are associated with various databases, based on scraping that was done in other Throughput repositories. The challenge, is that when a user searches for repositories that are associated with a database they may find a large number of resources that aren't helpful in a "cookbook" sense.

To help us we can look at some code repositories and see if we can categorize them. We use the following call directly against the database:

```cypher
MATCH (tyc:TYPE {type: 'schema:CodeRepository'})
MATCH (tyb:TYPE {type: 'schema:DataCatalog'})
MATCH (r:OBJECT)-[:isType]-(tyc)
  WHERE exists(r.name)
WITH r, tyb
MATCH (d:OBJECT)-[:isType]-(tyb)
MATCH (d)<-[:Target]-(:ANNOTATION)-[:Target]->(r)
  WITH DISTINCT r, COLLECT(d) AS dbs, rand() AS number
RETURN dbs[0].name, r.name, r.url
ORDER BY number
LIMIT 100
```

This returns the set of repositories with `name` properties that are connected directly to a database, because some repositories can be connected to many databases, be only choose one database per repository and we add a random integer to the result set (`rand() as number`) to ensure that we get a distinct subset (`n = 100`) of all the results.

Broadly, we're looking at a few categories:

### Education

Elements of the repository serve to house educational resources. This may include:

- Book
- Class assignment 
- Class notes 
- Documentation of use
- Syllabus
- Tutorial

### Analysis

Elements of this repository serve as the primary analysis for a workflow. This may include: 

- Comparative data use/reuse
- Integrative data use/reuse 
- Replication 

### Application 
Using data or database's API's within an application. This may include: 

- Independent reuse 
- Programmatic access through API 

### Archiving

There is data that is stored in this repository.

### Informational

This is primarily things like websites.

- Scraping database registries 

### Miscellaneous

This is for repositories that don't fit within current categories. 

- Article with database citations  
- Documentation of methods 
- Mining articles with database links
