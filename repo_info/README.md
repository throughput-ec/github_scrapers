# Get Secondary Repository Information

Throughput has scraped nearly 100,000 Github repositories, pulling only information about the repository name, the owner/organization and the databases or resources to which the repository is associated.

This script is intended to harvest secondary information from repositories, including the number of commits, number of contributors and other information that would help an individual assess the "worth" of a repository to them.
